## Steps
1. Data Loading and Splitting
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Creation and Training
4. Making Predictions
5. Model Evaluation
6. Visualization

## Results
- Mean Squared Error
- R^2 Score



## Conclusion
Linear regression is a powerful tool for predicting continuous outcomes. This project demonstrates its application in predicting house prices.
